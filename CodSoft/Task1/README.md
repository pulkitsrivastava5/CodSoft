# Simple Starter Website

This repository contains a small, responsive static website scaffold (HTML+C S S+JavaScript). Use this as a starting point — change content, colors, and layout as needed.

Included files:
- `Task1.html` — main page (index-style). Edit this file to change content.
- `styles.css` — site styles.
- `script.js` — small JavaScript for nav and form behavior.

How to run locally:
1. Open `Task1.html` in any web browser.
2. Or start a simple local server (recommended) and open http://localhost:5500 or similar. Example commands (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 5500
# Then open http://localhost:5500/Task1.html in your browser
```

Next steps:
- Tell me what the site should be (portfolio, business landing page, blog, etc.).
- Provide branding: logo, color choices, fonts, and sample text.
- I can wire up a real contact form (serverless or Node backend) or add pages, animations, and images.
